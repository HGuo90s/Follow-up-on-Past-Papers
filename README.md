# Stock-Market-Response-to-Unemployment-News
The project originally arose as a undergraduate research project based on existing papers. The first proposal of this project was raised in fall 2019. Back in spring 2019, a tentative conclusion was reached. The topic is interesting to explore, and some of the codes are shared on Github. Further amendment or improvement will be made if necessary. 

## Dataset
